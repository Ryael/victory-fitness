          <h2>Strive For Greatness</h2>
          <p> When people think about great victories, they often think of grandiose accomplishments. While this is technically correct, those accomplishments are built upon a foundation of goal adherence and many smaller milestones. Every small step taken is a victory. With enough steps taken, success will take shape and be realised in time. </p>
          <p id="end-page"> We here at Victory Fitness take your fitness goals and break them down into smaller, more manageable steps. We approach your goals at a pace that suits you. No matter whether your aim is to lose weight, tone up, gain lean muscle, or simply to develop a healthy lifestyle, we will accomplish it together! Our team aren't just personal trainers; we aim to educate and improve your mindset as well. </p>
